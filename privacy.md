# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

**noracami** ("we", "us", or "our") operates **High Society** (the "Activity"). This policy explains how we handle information when you use our Discord Activity.

### 1. Information We Collect

We are committed to user privacy. We **do not** collect "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) such as your real name, email address, or phone number.

However, to provide gameplay features, we may access the following via the Discord Embedded App SDK:

- **Discord User ID:** A unique numerical identifier.
- **Discord Username & Avatar:** Used for in-game display only (e.g., showing the current bidder or player status).

### 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Gameplay Persistence:** We use your Discord User ID to save your game progress, bidding history, or player statistics on our backend server.
- **Real-time Interaction:** To allow you to participate in auctions and interact with other players in the same Discord voice channel.
- **We do not track you outside of this Activity.**

### 3. Data Storage and Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the limited data we store (User IDs and game states). Game session data is retained for **30 days** after your last activity. You may request deletion at any time.

### 4. Third-Party Services

Our Activity runs within the Discord platform. Please refer to Discord's Privacy Policy for how they handle your data. We do not sell or share your information with any other third parties.

### 5. Children's Privacy

The Activity is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your country). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

### 6. Your Rights

If you wish to have your game data (linked to your Discord User ID) deleted from our database, please contact us.

### 7. Local Storage

We use browser **localStorage** to store reconnection tokens and UI preferences. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
